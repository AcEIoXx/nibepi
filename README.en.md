NibePi is an IoT product for your Nibe heatpump
With a Raspberry Pi Zero+RS485 HAT you can communicate with your heatpump by serial protocol. NibePi can fit inside the shell of the heatpump and be powered directly from the terminals.
NibePi supports a lot of Nibe heatpumps, including: Nibe F370,F470,F730,F750,F1145,F1245,F1155,F1255,VVM225,310,320,325,500.SMO20-40<br>
The foundation in this product is built on Node.JS and Node-RED. If the project dosent suit your needs completly it's easy to make your own project with this as a base.

One of the main features in this project is that NibePi is a dependable solution, the filesystem runs in a read-only mode and that makes it almost resistant to a corrupt SD-card. Since no data is written to the SD-card regulary it will not be worn out.<br>
Note that data is written to the SD-card when you change a setting in the user interface. <br>
